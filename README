How it works:
=============
The folder containing your script will be encrypted with a password only known by you and a trusted person. 

When you die the trustee will go to the webpage and insert the password to decrypt and run your script. When he first attempts to do this the script will not be run, but instead a fail-safe period will start and you will be contacted so that if you're not actually dead you can still stop the procedure 

If the fail safe period has ended without you cancelling the procedure, then the trustee can insert his password again, and this time the script will actually be decrypted and run.

Installation:
=============
Open install.php and follow the instructions.

Requirements:
=============
- linux 
- php
- gpg
- a server that will be online after your death/imprisonment/disappearance

License:
========
GNU Affero GPL v3 or later
